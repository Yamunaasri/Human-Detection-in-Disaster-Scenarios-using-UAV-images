# Human Detection in Disaster Scenarios Using UAV Images

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for detecting humans in disaster scenarios using images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The goal is to enhance rescue operations by providing real-time, accurate, and automated detection of individuals in areas affected by natural or man-made disasters. Leveraging advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system can analyze UAV images and identify humans amidst challenging environmental conditions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes UAV-captured images to detect humans quickly and efficiently.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models for precise detection.
- **Robustness**: Designed to work effectively under various environmental conditions, such as low light, debris, and occlusions.
- **Scalability**: Supports integration with multiple UAV platforms and can handle large datasets.
- **Visualization**: Provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing detected humans on UAV images.

## Applications

- Search and rescue missions
- Disaster relief operations
- Monitoring and surveillance in emergency scenarios

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow or PyTorch
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers-based architectures
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Flask, or Streamlit
- **Hardware**: Compatible with standard GPU setups for faster inference

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available UAV image datasets containing human annotations. Custom datasets collected from simulated disaster scenarios can also be incorporated to improve performance and adaptability.

**Example Datasets:**

- VisDrone Dataset
- UAV Human Detection Dataset

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/Human-Detection-in-Disaster-Scenarios-using-UAV-images.git
    cd Human-Detection-in-Disaster-Scenarios-using-UAV-images
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download and prepare the dataset:

    - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
    - Follow the preprocessing steps in `data_preprocessing.md`.

## Usage

To check the model outputs on UAV images:

1. Run the `main.py` script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The outputs, including the detected humans, will be displayed.

## Challenges

- Handling occlusions and partial visibility of humans.
- Detecting humans in varying environmental conditions (e.g., smoke, rain, rubble).
- Balancing computational efficiency with detection accuracy.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time video feed processing.
- Develop a lightweight model for deployment on edge devices.
- Incorporate thermal imaging for enhanced detection in low-visibility scenarios.
- Extend detection capabilities to identify other objects of interest in disaster scenarios.
